```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(mosaic)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```
Functions in the {mosaic} package have a data= argument as well as a ~ argument that specifies which variable of interest from the data= argument the function is to be applied to.

```{r}
f <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/difiore/ada-2022-datasets/main/IMDB-movies.csv"
d <- read_csv(f, col_names = TRUE)
d %>% filter(startYear %in% 1920:1979, runtimeMinutes %in% 60:180) %>%
  mutate("decade"=case_when(startYear %in% 1920:1929~"20s",
                            startYear %in% 1930:1939~"30s",
                            startYear %in% 1940:1949~"40s",
                            startYear %in% 1950:1959~"50s",
                            startYear %in% 1960:1969~"60s",
                            startYear %in% 1970:1979~"70s"
                            )
         )
```
